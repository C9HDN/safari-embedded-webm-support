# Safari Embedded WebM Support

Gets embedded WebM videos playing in Safari on supported imageboards: 4chan and 8chan.

This script requires two more safari extensions to run. 

First install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari) and the [VLC Web Plugin](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). The VLC Web Plugin can be found by clicking on the dropdown.

Next, [click here](https://github.com/b50/safari-embedded-webm-support/raw/master/webm.user.js) to install this script.

That's it for 8chan however to get this working on 4chan, install [4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) and disable Image Hover in the settings.
