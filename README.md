# Safari Embedded WebM Support
Gets embedded WebM videos to play in Safari on supported imageboards.

Currently supports 4chan and 8chan.

## How to install
This script requires two more safari extensions to run. 

First install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari) and the [VLC Web Plugin](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). The VLC Web Plugin can be found by clicking on the dropdown.

Once you've downloaded the two extensions, [click here to install this script](https://github.com/b50/safari-embedded-webm-support/raw/master/webm.user.js).

You should now be able to view embedded WebM in the supported imageboards.

## Other imageboards and sites?
This could easily be modified to work on other websites or imageboards. Please submit a pull request with more sites!
